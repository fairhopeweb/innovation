## Congressional Hackathon 6.0

### Description
Hosted by Speaker Mike Johnson, Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor, this event will bring together a bipartisan group of Members of Congress, Congressional staff, Legislative Branch agency staff, open government and transparency advocates, civic hackers, and developers from digital companies to explore the role of digital platforms in the legislative process.     

The first hour will include brief remarks from Speaker Johnson, Leader Jeffries, House Chief Administrator Szpindor, and updates on the digital and data efforts within the Legislative Branch. Participants will then be invited to break into different groups to actively brainstorm and explore new ideas on how to leverage technology to improve and open the legislative branch. Group topics will likely include legislative workflow and data, constituent casework and services, community communication and engagement, and artificial intelligence. Participants are encouraged to brainstorm new ideas in these areas in advance of the event. All participants will reconvene for the final hour to hear recommendations and ideas from each group.    
  
Staff with the Congressional Data Task Force will be in attendance.
